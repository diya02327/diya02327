# 👋 Hi there, I'm Diya Gandhi

🎓 Graduate Student in Information Systems @ Northeastern University  
📍 Based in Boston, MA | 💼 Actively seeking Spring 2026 internships (ML / NLP / Data Science / GenAI)  
🧠 I love building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems — especially with AI, data, and code.

## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

I'm a driven machine learning enthusiast with a strong foundation in data science, MLOps, and NLP. From deploying fine-tuned LLMs to building full-stack AI apps, I enjoy combining rigorous analysis with real-world impact.

I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can own end-to-end solutions — from data wrangling to deployment — and continuously push the boundaries of what's possible with GenAI.

In short: I like building things that think. 🤖
